# CREDIT CARD RISK MODELLING

problem statement:-
we have customers data
we are trying to predict whether or not give a loan

# Banking->

asset= loan product ->housing loan,personal loan, vechile loan, group loan, education loan, credit card
libability= current account, fixed deposit. saving account, Recurrent deposit

NPA-> non performing asset - loan that is defaulted
disbursed amount-> loan amt given to a customer
osp -> out standing principle -> balance leftover to return , zero at end
dpd -> days past due
par -> portfolio at risk osp when dpd >0
npa -> loan account whn dpd >90 days

credit risk type in Banking
dpd = 0 -> NDA non delinquient amt
dpd 0 - 30 -> standard monitoring account
dpd 31 - 60 -> SMA2
dpd 61 - 90 -> SMA3
dpd 90 -100 -> NPA
dpd >180 -> written off

NPA improve = loan portfolio quality of the bank will be better = market sentiment will be good = stock market improve

Gross NPA 3-5 % osp default
Net NPA 0.01 % povisioning amout subtracted
